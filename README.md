# Employee-Attendance-System
A facial recognition-based employee clock-in/out system. This will include a webcam interface, facial recognition, and dashboard to view attendance records.

## User Roles

- `admin`: Full access, can manage users and view all attendance.
- `manager`: Can view attendance records for their team (add logic as needed).
- `employee`: Can view and mark their own attendance.

> Only an admin should register other admins or assign roles. For demo/testing, you may expose the role field in registration, but for production, restrict this to admin only.
